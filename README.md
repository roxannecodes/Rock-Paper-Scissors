# Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Project:
 - We were initially asked to write the code for a single round of rock paper scissors on the console, and in a subsequent lesson were asked to write a program for a 5 round game and connect it with a GUI.

 - This was my FIRST real project, and although the curriculum instruction was limited, I thoroughly enjoyed the trial and errors that finally lead me to the solution :)


- Time-frame:
~ 20 hrs (CSS:5, JS:15).

*** UPDATE: added a feature to also display the user's and computer's selection after each round (above the scores) ***

### Learning points:

- DOM modification methods to connect the GUI with the program of the game.
- Efficient development and utilization of helper functions.
- Programming buttons with event listeners and application of event handlers
- CSS grid
