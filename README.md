# Rock, Paper, Scissors
### Demo ðŸ‘‰https://roxannecodes.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/
### Project:
 - We were initially asked to write the code for a single round of rock paper scissors on the console, and then were asked to write a program for a 5 round game and connect it with a GUI in a subsequent lesson.

 - This was my FIRST real project, and although the curriculum instruction was limited, I thoroughly enjoyed the trials and errors that eventually lead me to this solution :)


- Time-frame: ~ 20 hrs (CSS:5, JS:15).

*** UPDATE: added a feature to also display the user's and computer's selection after each round ***

### Learning points:

- DOM modification methods to connect the GUI with the program of the game.
- Efficient development and utilization of helper functions.
- Programming buttons with event listeners and application of event handlers
- Git (and the importance of version control)
- Responsive layouts using flexbox, CSS grid, and media queries.
